#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/genomeSidekick](https://shinyappstore.com/a/genomeSidekick)__

GenomeSidekick is a user-friendly bioinformatics application tailored for beginners to visualize their data, specifically RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. It simplifies the data analysis process, eliminating the need for in-depth bioinformatics knowledge. The app provides an overview of its various tabs, with the default setting displaying the first 10 rows of data, extendable up to 100 rows. Users can navigate through the data by clicking the "Next" button or the corresponding number. A search function is available, but it's important to note that it will return all rows containing the searched term, not just exact matches. To group genes on the same chromosome, users can click the column name for the chromosome column, allowing automatic sorting, and columns can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on their titles.
